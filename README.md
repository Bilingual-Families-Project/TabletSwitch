Bilingual Families Project's online study: Word learning task. 
*  In this task we are investigating bilingual toddlers’ learning of cross-language synonyms (i.e., translation equivalents) in immediate translated sentences versus single language sentences.
*  Bilingual toddlers’ word learning will be assessed with an online asynchronous experiment. The design uses repeated measures, with condition (Immediate Translation condition vs. One-Language-At-A-Time condition) as within-subjects factor. Children will be taught and tested on four novel word-object pairings; half of the pairings will occur in immediate translated sentences (i.e., Immediate Translation condition) and half will occur in single language sentences (i.e., One-Language-At-A-Time condition). The experiment will be divided in two blocks, blocked by condition with the block order counterbalanced across participants.
